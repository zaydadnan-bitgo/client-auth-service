## Why

Sometimes we commit to the Git repo files that are generated by the build
step, like `dist/app.js`. We expect the developer to run the `npm run build`
before committing the source files, but often I forget. Setting up the
[pre-commit](https://github.com/bahmutov/pre-git#readme) also does not help
much - the check runs too late.

The CI runs `npm run build` step, but we do not often check if there are
changed files, which means there is a discrepancy. This tool actually checks
and stops the build if there are changed files on CI.

## Install

Install as a dev tool

```
npm i -D stop-build
```

## Use

Add to your CI script after the build step. If the build step changes files
that are Git tracked, the `stop-build` command will exit with non-zero status
breaking the build. For example, `.travis.yml` file

```yaml
script:
  - npm run build
  - $(npm bin)/stop-build
```

Prints changes and exits with code 1 if any found

```sh
⚠️ there are 2 changed files
M package.json
M src/index.js
```
